# hello-world

Hello people,
I am Bamjan. I am  graduated student of business informatics and electronic business. 
While I was on college, my main goal was to learn everything about economy in IT, and to see how things work from theory perspective.

Now i think its time to invest more of my time in programing. I have some basic knowledge in php, very little in Java and ofcourse i have  moderate knowledge in Html and css( last 2 are not programing languages i know ^^ ).

I have a bit of experience (1 year) in e-marketing. I Worked on social network management, seo optimisation and facebook/google ads.

I am currently employed as a junior system administrator in one big company with over 600 ppl. employed, and I hope I will be able to learn more about programing and be creative in my spare time.

I hope you are doing well, good reader, and maybe we could create something interesting together.

All the best.
Bamjan
